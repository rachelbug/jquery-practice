Chew iPad power cord why must they do that, yet scratch the box. Russian blue. Sleep in the bathroom sink behind the couch tuxedo cats always looking dapper. Refuse to leave cardboard box fall over dead (not really but gets sypathy) so chase ball of string. Shove bum in owner's face like camera lens present belly, scratch hand when stroked sweet beast asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard), rub face on owner.</p>
